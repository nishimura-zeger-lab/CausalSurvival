# CausalSurvival: causal survival methods for large-scale observational data

The CausalSurvival R package implements several causal survival methods for analyzing large-scale observational data with point treatment, baseline covariates and discrete time-to-event outcome with informative right-censoring. The estimation methods include inverse probability weighting (IPW, weighting by the inverse of propensity score and censoring probability), propensity score stratification (stratified Cox model), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and augmented IPW (AIPW) in estimating the difference in survival probability and restricted mean survival time at one or more pre-specified time points.
